# failure-boosting

This code allows to calculate the cost of (directional) failure boosting attacks as discussed in https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/193.pdf

main_multitarget_limited.py: calculates the cost of a multitarget attack
main_attackcostvstargets.py: calculates the cost of multitarget attack in function of the number of targets

Generation of failure boosting curves is costly, but should be done only once (intermediate results are saved). If you would like the intermediate results you can contact the authors.
